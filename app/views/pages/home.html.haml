        Hack Club is a non-profit initiative that works with high school students to
        start and lead programming clubs at their schools. We provide all the
        tools for starting and leading clubs including a baseline coding
        curriculum, free software tools, and community building training.
      %p
        In the US alone, 3 in 4 high schools don’t offer any coding classes and we’re setting out to help students change that. We think coding is a superpower that anyone can learn and we want to provide every student, regardless of ethnicity, gender, or socioeconomic status, the opportunity to learn to code.

    %h4 What is Hack Club?
    %p Hack Club is a non-profit initiative that works with high school students to start and lead programming clubs at their schools. We provide all the tools for starting and leading clubs including a baseline coding curriculum, free software tools, and community building training.
    %p Each club typically spans the school year, regularly meeting weekly or biweekly. Clubs are led by high school hackers who want to bring the hackathon culture back to their schools. No previous coding experience is required.
    %h4 Why Hack Club?
    %p Instead of focusing on teaching a set curriculum at hack clubs, Hack Club focuses on building all-inclusive families where members build things together. This results in: (1) hack clubs engaging groups that are underrepresented in computer science and attracting members who might not normally sign up for computer science classes, and (2) building confidence, courage, and skills in members through integration with the broader hacking community.
    %h4 What is Hacking?
    %p Although the media has projected negative connotations onto the idea of hacking, we only use it in its most positive definition: figuring out creative solutions to problems that we all face.
